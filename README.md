# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Examples in C++ and Python
This project provides examples of implementing machine learning and deep learning models in C++ and Python. The goal is to demonstrate the similarities and differences in syntax and style between the two languages and to provide a starting point for developers who want to implement machine learning and deep learning models in C++ or Python.

## Requirements
To run the C++ examples, you will need the following libraries installed:

Armadillo mlpack
dlib

To run the Python examples, you will need the following libraries installed:

NumPy
scikit-learn
PyTorch

## Usage
To run the machine learning example in C++, navigate to the cpp directory and run the following command: 

g++ -std=c++11 machine_learning.cpp -o machine_learning && ./machine_learningTo run the machine learning 

example in Python, navigate to the python directory and run the following command:

python machine_learning.py 

To run the deep learning example in C++, navigate to the cpp directory and run 
the following command: 

g++ -std=c++11 deep_learning.cpp -o deep_learning && ./deep_learning                            

To run the deep learning example in Python, navigate to the python directory and run the following command:

python deep_learning.py
